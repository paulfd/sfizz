/**
 * @brief This class is the core of the sfizz library. In C++ it is the main point
 * of entry and in C the interface basically maps the functions of the class into
 * C bindings.
 *
 * The JACK client provides an example of how you can use this class as an entry
 * point for your own projects. Just include this header and compile against the
 * static library. If you wish to use the shared library you should rather use the
 * C bindings.
 *
 * This class derives from the Parser and provides a specific set of callbacks; see
 * the Parser documentation for more precisions.
 *
 * The Synth object contains:
 * - A set of SFZ Regions that get filled up upon parsing
 * - A set of Voices that play the sounds of the regions when triggered.
 * - Some singleton resources, particularly the midiState which contains the current
 *      midi status (note is on or off, last note velocity, current CC values, ...)
 *      as well as a FilePool that preloads and give access to files.
 *
 * The synth is callback based, in the sense that it renders audio block by block
 * using the renderBlock() function. Between each call to renderBlock() you have to
 * send the relevent events for the block in the form of MIDI events: noteOn(),
 * noteOff(), cc(). You can also send pitchBend(), aftertouch() and bpm()
 * events -- but as of 2019 they are not handled.
 *
 * All events have a delay information, which must be less than the size of the
 * next call to renderBlock() in units of frames or samples. For example, if you
 * will call to render a block of 256 samples, all the events you send to the
 * synth should have a delay parameter strictly lower than 256. Events beyond 256
 * may be completely ignored by the synth as the incoming event buffer is cleared
 * during the renderBlock() call. You SHOULD also feed the midi events in the correct
 * order.
 *
 * The jack_client.cpp file contains examples of the most classical usage of the
 * synth and can be used as a reference.
